# gen_conf

A simple tool made to generate initial, winstate, and config files for common formations.

To get started, simply compile the binary, tell it where cablegen is, and follow the directions.

After running, move the generated_initial, generated_winstate, and cablegen.conf to wherever you may need them, making sure that they are all in the same folder.
